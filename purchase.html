        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Will you do commission work?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>In most cases I do not do commissioned work. The type of artwork shown on my website is the type of work that I prefer to do. However, I would consider making customizations to the work that you see on my site to fit a customer's specific tastes. But do feel free to run your project idea past me. If I do decide to take on a commissioned project a contract would be used and a 50% deposit would be required.
          </p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can these products be displayed outside?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>In general my work is intended for indoor placement only.
            I use a clearcoat finish intended for indoor environments to preserve the colors. If placed outdoors the impact of the sun's direct UV rays, heat, rain, and blowing sand will affect the copper finish to some extent over time so placement in an unprotected area is not recommended, unless you want a weathered patina to develop.
            <br>
            <br>
            If I determine that a piece of art is repairable, any repairs to restore the original colors would be done at an additional expense to the customer. When I do make a product intended for outdoor placement, a widely used outdoor clearcoat product such as Permalac or Incralac will be used. Since these clearcoat products cost much more than interior clearcoat products, the final price of the artwork will be a bit higher.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you choose to display any of these indoor products in a location exposed to the weather, it is best to choose a location that minimizes the impact of the hot sun and moisture. Note that surfaces on on which glass enamel coating is used will not experience color fade.

        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Will you make an exact copy of another piece? </button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Each piece is considered unique. Although I may use the same finishing and construction of any one piece there will be some variation in terms of shape and coloration between similar pieces.
          </p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Will you invoice? </button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            No. All sales must be paid in full at the time of purchase.
          </p>
        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Will you ship?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Shipping has become very expensive and too much to just build into my prices. I will ship to lower forty eight states. The customer is responsible for all shipping costs. No returns are accepted unless shipping box and contents are received in damaged condition, photographed and I am notified within one day of shipment receipt to arrange return shipping. If the shipment to customer arrives damaged the customer does not pay for shipping returned artwork.
